required liberary------------------------>
1. cv2 ("pip install opencv-python") use this command to install it.
2. face_recognition ("pip install face-recognition") use this command to install it.

I will recommend to use anaconda commend promp to install this liberaries and can also use spyder (IDE) to run this code.
